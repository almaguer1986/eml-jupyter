"""eml-jupyter — rich notebook display for the EML substrate.

Loading the extension installs an IPython display formatter that
augments every ``sp.Basic`` cell output with a Pfaffian profile
strip + identification badge underneath the usual LaTeX rendering.

    %load_ext eml_jupyter

After that, evaluating any SymPy expression in a cell renders both
the math AND the EML annotation:

    >>> import sympy as sp
    >>> 1 / (1 + sp.exp(-sp.Symbol('x')))
    1/(1 + exp(-x))
    [EML  predicted_depth=2  pfaffian_r=1  identified: sigmoid (canonical)]

A cell magic is also registered:

    %%eml_witness
    1 / (1 + exp(-x))

This prints the full ``UniversalityWitness`` (profile + identification
+ canonical path + Lean-verified flag) in HTML form.

Both surfaces use ``eml_witness.universality_witness`` under the
hood, so the display picks up the same Lean-verified flag once
``EML_Universality.lean`` lands and the user verifies it.
